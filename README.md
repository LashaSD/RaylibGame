# RaylibGame

Welcome to **RaylibGame**, This project was developed as part of a university Presentation, and we’re proud to share that it earned **maximum grade** for its implementation.

## 🎮 Game Overview

**RaylibGame** is a 2D game built using **Raylib** and **Farseer Physics**. The project is based on an **Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture** and focuses on demonstrating modular and maintainable software design.

In the game, you spawn as a **knight** in a level and can **attack enemy knights**. However, don’t expect too much from this game—it’s more of a tech demo than a finished product. 😊

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Raylib**: Lightweight library for rendering and input handling.  
- **Farseer Physics**: Physics engine for 2D games.  
- **C#**: Used for implementing the game and ECS architecture.
